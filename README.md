# APS105_Reversi_Game
DISCLAIMER: Copying code directly for a course leads to an academic offense.

A remake of the game Reversi which is available in the Apple Store and Google Play Store. The game is played by 2 players, and the winner is eventually decided by whoever flips the most number of tiles of the opponent's at the end of the game.
